### Step 1: Preparing the Environment

1. **Install Python (if not already installed):** Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. This can be verified by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in the command line or terminal. If not installed, download and install it from the official Python website.

2. **Extract the Project Files:** Unzip the provided project file (`requirements.zip`) to your desired location. This will be your project directory.

### Step 2: Setting Up the Virtual Environment

3. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the project directory where you extracted the files.

4. **Create a Virtual Environment:** Run the following command to create a new virtual environment inside your project directory:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   Replace `python` with `python3` if your system requires it to invoke Python 3.x.

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows, run:
     ```
     .\.venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux, run:
     ```
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 3: Installing Dependencies

6. **Install Required Packages:** With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 4: Running the Project

7. **Run the Project:** You can now run the project by executing the main Python script. If, for example, the main script is `main.py`, you can run it with:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   Again, replace `python` with `python3` if necessary.

### Step 5: Deactivating the Virtual Environment

8. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:** Once you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply running:
   ```
   deactivate
   ```
